** Course Structure

Two days a week, Tuesday / Thursday should be the idea, and it'll probably be at Math 293.

*** Day 1, Dyl "Lectures"

*** Day 2, Recitation-Style Group Work and Presented Solutions

*** One or Two Projects

- Midterm Partner Project, 20/25 minute presentation.

- Representation Theory
- Mathematical Physics
- Algebraic Geometry
- Projective Geometry
- Arithmetic Geometry
- Finite Geometry
- Category Theory
  
** Notes

We'll try for shared overleaf doc with course notes and one doc for student contributed solutions.
